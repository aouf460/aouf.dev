# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue: https://aouf460.github.io/aouf.dev/ not working

### Common Causes & Solutions:

1. **GitHub Actions Required (2024 Update)**
   - GitHub Pages now requires GitHub Actions for deployment
   - Solution: Use the provided `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file

2. **Repository Settings Check**
   - Go to Repository Settings → Pages
   - Ensure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions"
   - NOT "Deploy from a branch"

3. **File Structure Issues**
   - Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory
   - Check that all files are properly uploaded

4. **Repository Name vs URL**
   - If repository is named `aouf.dev`, URL should be `https://aouf460.github.io/aouf.dev/`
   - If repository is named `aouf460.github.io`, URL should be `https://aouf460.github.io/`

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Create Repository**
   ```
   Repository name: aouf.dev (or aouf460.github.io for root deployment)
   Visibility: Public
   ```

2. **Upload Files**
   ```bash
   cd dist-deploy
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy Omar Aouf Portfolio"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/aouf460/aouf.dev.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

4. **Check Deployment Status**
   - Repository → Actions tab
   - Look for successful workflow runs
   - Check for any error messages

### If Still Not Working:

1. **Check GitHub Actions Status**
   - Repository → Actions tab
   - Look for failed deployments (red X)
   - Click on failed runs to see error logs

2. **Verify File Structure**
   - Ensure `index.html` is present in root
   - Check `.nojekyll` file exists
   - Verify all assets are properly linked

3. **Test with Simple HTML**
   - Create a minimal `index.html` to test basic functionality
   - Add debugging content to confirm deployment

### Next Steps:
1. Create/update repository with GitHub Actions workflow
2. Configure Pages settings to use GitHub Actions
3. Wait for deployment and check Actions tab for status
4. Test the live URL after successful deployment
